# First Flutter App
Welcome to my first app created using Flutter as the framework and SDK, and Dart as the programming language. This app is designed to run on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Overview
This project is inspired by a tutorial from Academind on YouTube. Through this project, I have learned the basics of Flutter, the Dart programming language, and how to use Android Studio (Kolla version) as the integrated development environment (IDE). The tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on building a basic app from scratch.

## Reference
For more detailed guidance and step-by-step instructions, you can refer to the tutorial video:

# Note
Ensure that all plugins listed in pubspec.yaml are correct and updated to the latest versions before running the app. You can do this by running:

flutter pub outdated
flutter pub upgrade


## Learning Resources
Flutter Documentation: flutter.dev

Dart Documentation: dart.dev


# To make this app run on local device/ on your mobile:
1. firstly on developer options in mobile
2. enable USB debugging and install via USB
3. connect system and mobile through USB cable
4. Run the main.dart file in lib folder
